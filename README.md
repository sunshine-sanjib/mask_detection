# facemask_detection
Face Mask Detection System  The Face Mask Detection System is a computer vision–based project designed to automatically identify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real time. The model uses deep learning and transfer learning techniques to achieve accurate and efficient classification from images and live video streams. This project leverages a pre-trained MobileNetV2 architecture for feature extraction and a custom classification head for binary classification (Mask / No Mask). The lightweight nature of MobileNetV2 makes the system suitable for real-time applications with limited computational resources.
